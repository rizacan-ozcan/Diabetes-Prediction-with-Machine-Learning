# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This work analysis the usage of machine learning on diabetes prediction through a sample dataset.

# Business Problem
It is desired to develope a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics specified.

# Dataset Story
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood BMI: To express the Body mass index DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the Diabetes percentage Age: To express the age Outcome: To express the final result 1 is Yes and 0 is No
